Raspberry Pi Photo Booth for Weddings, etc. - incl. Google Photo Upload

Inspired by https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=75899 and http://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pi-photo-booth/

For a weeding this summer I wanted to bring a photo booth that can be on the event and uploads all photos to a stream available to the guests. 

While I found some very good inspiration in the web, none of the existing projects did fullfil all my requirements:

- Big red button as shutter release
- Live preview to arange pictures
- sound and leds to draw attention
- live upload to an event photo stream
